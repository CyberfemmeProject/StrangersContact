            <div class="Text2">This project aims to raise awareness about the dangers of cybersexual 
                crime and online harassment. <br><br>Women, particularly teenagers, are frequently targeted and subjected 
                to a new form of serious crime through Telegram chat. <br>
                Despite the seriousness of the situation, online harassment has become a normalized, 
                even trivialized, issue that is often joked about. 
                The perpetrators often threaten their victims with private photos or videos obtained through blackmail, 
                which leaves many too afraid to report the abuse. <br><br>
                It is important that we educate ourselves about the tactics used in this type of crime in order to prevent it from continuing to occur and escalate.
