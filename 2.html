              This website and the game "Stranger" was created as part of a Master's thesis exploring the experiences of women in internet and the impact of internet art on feminism.
              <br>
              The game project aims to raise awareness about the dangers of cybersexual 
                crime and online harassment. <br><br>Women, particularly teenagers, are frequently targeted and subjected 
                to a new form of serious crime through social media or Telegram chat rooms. <br>
                Despite the seriousness of the situation, online harassment has become a normalized, 
                even trivialized, issue that is often joked about. 
                The perpetrators often threaten their victims with private photos or videos obtained through blackmail, 
                which leaves many too afraid to report the abuse. <br><br>
                It is important that we educate ourselves about the tactics used in this type of crime in order to prevent it from continuing to occur and escalate.
