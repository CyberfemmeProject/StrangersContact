                  <p>I received a message from someone I don't know, saying he like 
                    my appearance and wants to get to know me. I asked how he got my number,
                     and he replied that he saw it on a comment I made for my friend's Facebook. 
                     The post was only visible to her friends so I found it</p> creepy.<p>
                     So, I politely refused and told him I didn't want to receive </p>contact<p> from someone I don't know. 
                     However, he became aggressive towards me for refusing him</p>
